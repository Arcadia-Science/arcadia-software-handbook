# Arcadia Science Software Handbook

The repository is home to the core software engineering guides and policies at [Arcadia Science](https://www.arcadiascience.com/). If you're curious about where to begin, [the source control policy document](/guides-and-policies/policy-source-control) is a good place to start!

## Naming convention

- A **guide** document describes software engineering best practices for reusable and reproducible work. These are strong suggestions but exceptions to the rule can happen.
- A **policy** document describes a company operating policy that all Arcadians are expected to comply with.

## Contributing
