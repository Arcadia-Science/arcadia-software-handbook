# Arcadia Science Software Handbook

This repository is home to the core software engineering guides and standards at [Arcadia Science](https://www.arcadiascience.com/). If you're curious about where to begin, [the source control standard document](/guides-and-standards/standard-source-control.md) is a good place to start!

## Naming conventions

- A **guide** describes software engineering best practices for reusable and reproducible work. These are sensible defaults and exceptions to the rule are expected to happen.
- A **standard** describes a company-wide operating standard that all Arcadians are expected to comply with.
