# Feedback, contributions, and reuse

We try to be as open as possible with our work and make all of our code both available and usable. We love receiving feedback at any level, through comments on our pubs or Twitter and issues or pull requests here on GitHub. In turn, we routinely provide public feedback on other people’s work by [commenting on preprints](https://sciety.org/lists/f8459240-f79c-4bb2-bb55-b43eae25e4f6), filing issues on repositories when we encounter bugs, and contributing to open-source projects through pull requests and code review.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to our code. When we publish new versions of pubs, we include a link to the "Contributions" page for the relevant GitHub repo in the Acknowledgements/Contributors section. If someone’s contribution has a substantial impact on our scientific direction, the biological result of a project, or the functionality of our code, the pub’s point person may add that person as a formal contributor to the pub with "Critical Feedback" specified as their role.

Our policy is that external contributors cannot be byline-level authors on pubs, simply because we need to ensure that our byline authors are accountable for the quality and integrity of our work, and we must be able to enforce quick turnaround times for internal pub review. We apply this same policy to feedback on the text and other non-code content in pubs.

If you make a substantial contribution, you are welcome to publish it or use it in your own work (in accordance with the license — our pubs are CC BY 4.0 and our code is openly licensed). We encourage anyone to build upon our efforts.
